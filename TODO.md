# TDD Pain Points

+ Jest + React + Webpack preprocessing: I want to process files the same way I do during build right?
+ module paths: I like to structure tests to mirror app but I don't like '../../../../../../some/path/to/module/ugh'.
  I would like 'app/components/MyComponent'.
+ __tests__: I would like 'tests', and to be able to nest test related stuff in there
  to without jest picking it up and treating it like a test.
